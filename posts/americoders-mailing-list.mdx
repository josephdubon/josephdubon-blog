# Americoders, an education platform for the future
<a href='https://americoders.org'>americoders.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Americoders is an education platform I have been working on since early 2021.

It started when a friend & I started meeting up with our kids to do projects on code.org.

After many fun workshops and a strong interest from our community to learn to code and work with modern technologies I decided
to build the Americoders platform.

Please wish us luck as we start our journey to seek funding for our project.

For more information please visit the <a
href='https://americoders.org'>americoders.org</a> homepage and sign up for the mailing list.

<br/>
<br/>
### Thank you
To my friends and family.

I could not ask for a more supportive community.
<br/>
<strong>I cannot wait to officially launch this project in Summer 2022!</strong>
