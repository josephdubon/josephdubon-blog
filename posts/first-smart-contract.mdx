# Created, Deployed First Smart Contract
I really wanted to dive into some smart contract development. I am always interested in new technologies.

Web3 and blockchain are exciting new paths and I can't wait to explore this world even more. This was a great initial
introduction.

I went for a simple smart contract on the **Ropsten** test network using a virtual wallet (**Metamask**), **Solidity**,
**Hardhat**, and **Alchemy**.
<br/>
<br/>

## What is a smart contract?
The basis for **dApps**(Decentralized Application on the Blockchain) that are built on the blockchain are
**Smart contracts**.

Smart contracts are written in **Solidity** (for Ethereum) or **Cadence** (for Flow).
<br/>

+ Smart contracts are a collection of **executable functions** and a **set of data** defining the state, stored in a
decentralized manner at a specific address on the blockchain.

+ Smart contracts are typically much less complicated than traditional programs, but the **risks are much higher** - a
single bug is a pathway to millions of dollars drained in merely minutes!

+ A smart contract is a program that defines a set of rules, or defines a "contract" that autonomously executes encoded
rules once requested by a user on the blockchain. Once a smart contract is deployed, it will forever function
im an immutable manner  - it cannot be mutated, modified, manipulated or taken control of by a malicious user.
<br/>
<br/>

### Traits of Smart Contacts
+ **Transparency**  - Published to the blockchain, can be read and written by anyone who has access to the blockchain.
+ **Simplicity** - They are much less complex and simpler than most code-bases.
+ **Immutability** - It (typically) cannot be mutated, modified, or manipulated and is guaranteed to function
identically forever! No individual controls the smart contract.
